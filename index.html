						<h4>Origin of Ganggangsullae</h4>
						<p>It is believed that the games that were held at community festivals during the sowing and harvesting times of the ancient agricultural society were combined with the prayers for abundance in a fishery and safety, characteristic of coastal areas, and gradually developed into today's Ganggangsullae.</p>

				<p>‘Ganggangsullae’, widely practiced in the southwestern part of Korea, is one of the customs to pray for a good harvest and abundance. On the night of a bright full moon, dozens of village girls gather and hold hands to form a circle, and when one person sings the front part of ‘Ganggangsullae’, several people who are behind the scenes sing the song. This game continues with dancing all night long.</p>
				<p>This game is characterized by playing a playful depiction of rural or fishing village life, such as stepping on a tile, catching a mouse, etc while singing the Ganggangsullae song. As a performing art that is currently spread across Korea, this custom is a representative folk art of Korea.</p>
				<p>Ganggangsullae is an important traditional custom derived from rice farming culture and daily life in the countryside. It is easy to learn because of the simple melody and movement, and the women were sharing the spirit of cooperation, equality, and friendship by dancing Ganggangsullae.</p>

				<p>Ganggangsullae also refers to a series of folk songs to be sung during the circle dance with not only pre-determined chants, but also impromptu songs comprised of leading and following chants. The songs can be enjoyed in many ways, according to the excitement and mood of the atmosphere and the person leading each song. Anyone can sing apsori (leading chants) during Ganggangsullae, and the songs can be sung while going around, or in turn between groups. The choruses of Ganggangsullae are shorter than other folk songs for amusement, and therefore easy to learn and sing, bringing everyone together. Thanks to the short choruses, the narrative of apsori can be continued in following verses easily. Naturally, the lyrics of many Ganggangsullae songs are rich in storytelling. Every apsori is followed by choruses promoting a harmonious imbalance of melodies of the leading chants.</p>
				<p>Communities express their feelings through song. The lives of women singing Ganggangsullae are reflected in the lyrics, as these songs serve as a means to try and accept the pain and despair in the lives of women as part of their destiny. Inspired by the continuous relationship between people and nature in rural areas, the lyrics also offer praise of the beauty of nature. The songs go on to express their feelings in both a direct and indirect manner that ultimately leads to the wisdom of people to endure and overcome hardship being well reflected in the lyrics as well.</p>

				<blockquote>The narrative of Ganggangsullae songs can be categorized into official expressions and contextual expressions. Official expressions describe the feelings of women playing Ganggangsullae, the atmosphere of the scene, and their hopeful sentiment and wishes, whereas contextual expressions are primarily about love. Most of the love songs are conversations between lovers, or are about the feelings of joy, loneliness, longing, or despair that commonly accompany love. The lyrics of Ganggangsullae are a good example of typical Korean sentiment reflected in folk songs.</blockquote>
				<p>Also, the pains in women’s lives are well described in the lyrics, mainly deriving the hardships of daily life, conflict between mothers and daughters-inlaw, and longing for their own mothers’ love. There is a common sentiment of accepting their fate in the songs regarding the regret about the life lived among women. Many lyrics of Ganggangsullae are about flowers and the moon. The flowers represent the lives of people living in harmony, or life itself, while also capturing both an artistic and objective symbolism in the circle of nature that represents the lives of humble women yearning for their lovers. The moon, on the other hand, is the symbol of longing, connecting separated lovers, while serving as a poetic materialization of the feeling of loss.</p>
